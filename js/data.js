From a mere team member to the president of this cell, I have grown a lot when it comes to dealing with real-life challenges. Many of them come from my experience in SAIC. I have been a part of Student Alumni Interaction Cell since my 2nd semester in B.E programme. Most of my soft skills developed during my journey here. But being a president means not just to learn but to make everyone with you grow along.  And that's when great leaders are born. Like my seniors, I like to help my juniors and work alongside them. Another soft skill that I encounter was to accept your mistakes. I know we humans are made to be perfect, but everyone has their flaws. <br>Appart from the skills that I did grow upon, there were few achievements along the way as well. With the help of my coordinators, we were able to pull up great events like Troubleshoot and Global Leadership Summit 2018 at such a magnificent scale. For me, being the president is just a fancy tag that comes with great responsibilities to fulfil.",

As OEC, I came across many hurdles, one of them being to maintain interdepartmental synchronization and proper flow of tasks amongst them. It requires judicious managemental skill to overcome such scenarios. The most important thing that I learned during my journey was the ability to take charge of things and to lead a team with a common agenda. For me, learning along made this experience worth sharing.",

When my society presidents appointed me as OEC of GLS 2017, at first it seemed like everyone has to just blindly follow my lead. But being just appointed to be a leader doesn't make you one. I learned that the hard way when everything seems to fall apart. Luckily, my seniors helped me during my fall. They not only taught me the importance of working in a team but also focused on respecting each and everyone's opinion.<br>Working in a team means you should trust them. This was yet another soft skill that I developed during my time as OEC. In the end, it was 'we' who pulled off a successful event and not just 'I'.",
